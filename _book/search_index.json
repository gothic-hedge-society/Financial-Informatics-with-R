Depending on your OS, follow the instructions below to install R: 2.1.1.1 Mac OS X: Download and install the .pkg file for the latest version of R found here double-click it to install R. 2.1.1.2 Windows: Download the installer .exe file found here and double-click it to install R. You’ll also need Rtools. Download the .exe file found here and double-click it to install Rtools. Best to stick with the recommended version. 2.1.1.3 Ubuntu: If you’re using a different Linux distro, it’s assumed that you know what you’re doing – have at it :) We’re going to add the CRAN Project repository to your system’s sources list, run apt update, and then install R, plus the development package r-devel, from the CRAN repo. To do this, open a terminal and go through the following steps: Add the repo’s GPG key. sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys E298A3A825C0D65DFD57CBB651716619E084DAB9 Add the repository to your sources list. If you’re not using Ubuntu 18 (Bionic Beaver), don’t forget to change “bionic” to your version’s name in the command below. Allowed choices can be found here. sudo add-apt-repository &#39;deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu bionic-cran35/&#39; sudo apt update. Successful output confirms that the repo has been added; something like: Hit:2 https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu bionic-cran35/ InRelease Install R with: sudo apt install r-base r-devel Check that all’s well. The command sudo -i R should print out information about your R install and should look something like this: ``` R version 3.6.0 (2019-04-26) – “Planting of a Tree” Copyright (C) 2019 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit) R is free software and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. You are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions. Type ‘license()’ or ‘licence()’ for distribution details. Natural language support but running in an English locale R is a collaborative project with many contributors. Type ‘contributors()’ for more information and ‘citation()’ on how to cite R or R packages in publications. Type ‘demo()’ for some demos, ‘help()’ for on-line help, or ‘help.start()’ for an HTML browser interface to help. Type ‘q()’ to quit R. ### Install RStudio RStudio is the industry standard interactive development environment (IDE) for R, developed and maintained by a [company of the same name](https://www.rstudio.com/). Install RStudio by downloading and running the installer that matches your OS found [here](https://www.rstudio.com/). ### Install R Packages Open up RStudio and run the command below to install the packges listed: install.packages(c(“devtools”, “tidyverse”, “roxygen2”, “testthat”, “knitr”, “pkgdown”, “shiny”, “DT”, “dygraphs”, “plotly”, “xts”)) Go get a coffee because this will probably take a few minutes. ### Restart your computer Optional, but your computer works hard for you. Give it a break and let it restart. At the very least, exit RStudio. ### Check that all&#39;s well Run an example app hosted on GitHub. If it works, everything installed correctly: shiny::runGitHub( repo = “shiny-examples”, username = “rstudio”, subdir = “063-superzip-example” ) ``` 2.2 Setup "]
